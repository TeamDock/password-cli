# More about Password-cli
Every time we lose the password of some social network and we have to click on "I forgot my password", but we created the password-cli to correct this and keep your password in the most secure way possible, with just a command line you can get your password without any problems and the coolest thing... it's open source! ü•∂

# How to install
That simple! You can use:
  * npm: `npm i --global @dockteam/password-cli`
  * yarn: `yarn add global @dockteam/password-cli`

## Verify password
With [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) Api, you can check if your password was leaked in some hacker attack:
```
password-cli verify
```
or
```
password-cli verify --password <yourpassword>
```

## Save password
First of all, you need to create a passwordlist
You can see how to create [here](#create-a-passwordlist)

To save your password, use:
```
password-cli save <name>
```
The "name" argument is a means of identifying the password. Example: `league of legends`, `smurf valorant`, `youtube`...

Every time password-cli saves the password it checks the password, to bypass this use:
```
password-cli save <name> --noverify
```

The password is saved on the local machine and is encrypted in a key generated by the password-cli itself, the algorithm used to encrypt is `aes-256-gcm`

## Get password
To get your saved password use:
```
password-cli get <name>
```

## Passwordlist
Passwordlist is a list of passwords to make your passwords more organized. Examples: `games`, `social media`...
## Create a passwordlist
That simple:
```
password-cli passwordlist create
```

When created will generate a password, **never lose that password!**

If you don't show the password when creating the passwordlist use:
```
password-cli passwordlist create --hidden
```

## Delete a passwordlist
Also you can delete a passwordlist:
```
password-cli passwordlist delete <name>
```

## List all passwordlist
To list all passwordlist use: 
```
password-cli passwordlist

```
password-cli preset set <name>
```
To show a preset use: 
```
password-cli preset get <name>
```
To use the preset with `generate` command:
